<body style="text-align:center;"> For this assignment, I chose to build my Indian Ring-Necked Parakeet. I would have never considered having a bird as a pet, but one day, he showed up on my fence. As it turns out, birds are very sweet and affectionate animals, and also very funny. Having owned multiple different pets, I have been able to relate to many pet ownership experiences, and the unique experience that comes from owning a bird has encouraged me to research more about these fascinating pets.

<body> This is the 3D model of my Minecraft build. I intentionally chose this style of bird as I figured it would print out easily, but I have been mistaken and have made some tweaks to the original build. 	<p class="text-nowrap"</body>
